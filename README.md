## About AffiliateCoin
AffiliateCoin is a decentralised Affiliate Marketing network that uses Smart Contracts to create secure, indisputable transactions on the Blockchain.

Despite Affiliate Marketing having been around for over 25 years it has some fundamental flaws, including mistrust, delayed payments and limited Pay Per Action capability.

By removing the middleman we are creating an environment in which trust is no longer relied upon. Merchants will rest in the knowledge that they only pay for the completion of clearly defined end user tasks, and Publishers will rest knowing their efforts never go unrewarded.

With all transactions stored on the public ledger of the Blockchain, justice in Affiliate Marketing will become an indisputable matter of public record.
